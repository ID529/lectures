    - Keep in mind, your goal shouldn't be to memorize everything, but rather to 
      get a sense of what functionality is available to you, and how you could 
      reference this cheatsheet or follow up on its contents to make use of it.

Truly extra reading for those interested in advancing their conceptual understanding of ggplot2 and the possibilities in data visualization: 

  - *A Layered Grammar of Graphics, by Hadley Wickham* http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/layered-grammar.pdf
  - Start to get familiar with the ggplot2 book. We recommend starting with 
  subsection 1.2 "What is the grammar of graphics?" here: 
  https://ggplot2-book.org/introduction.html#what-is-the-grammar-of-graphics
  - The R Graph Gallery: https://r-graph-gallery.com/index.html 
  
Homework: 

  - Read in a dataset of your choice [we will give you some example datasets you can use] and create a figure using ggplot2. We want to see students include titles, subtitles, captions, data sources, legends, etc.

What you can expect from the instructional team: 

  - We will be reading your bios and working on sorting you into groups for the final
  presentation topics.
