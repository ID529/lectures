# logic {background-image='transition_slides/tyler-springhetti.jpg' background-color='black' background-opacity='60%'}

## logical operators 

:::{.fragment .small}
the first three <span class='carrot'>**logical operators**</span> we'll talk
about first are `!` ("not"), `&` ("and"), and `|` ("or").

:::{.incremental}
  * `!` negates (i.e., flips) the logical value placed on its right-hand-side
  * `&` returns `TRUE` if its left-hand-side and right-hand-side are both `TRUE`;  otherwise `FALSE`
  * `|` returns `TRUE` if at least one of its left-hand-side or right-hand-side are `TRUE`;  otherwise `FALSE`
:::
:::

## logical operators

:::{.fragment .small}
let's do a really simple handful of examples first
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
```r
! TRUE        # evaluates to: FALSE
TRUE & TRUE   # => TRUE
TRUE | FALSE  # => TRUE
```
:::

## logical operators

:::{.fragment .small}
in a rare case, you may need to determine if *only* one of the two arguments
given is `TRUE`, and in those cases you can use `xor(x,y)`.
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
```r
xor(TRUE, FALSE)  # => TRUE
xor(FALSE, TRUE)  # => TRUE
xor(TRUE, TRUE)   # => FALSE
xor(FALSE, FALSE) # => FALSE
```
:::

## logical operators

:::{.fragment .small}
R is a <span class='carrot'>**vectorized language**</span> (meaning: many of its functions and most basic
data types aim to work seamlessly with vectors of data), so these logical operators
are vectorized too.
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
```r
! c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)         # => c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
c(TRUE, TRUE) & c(TRUE, FALSE) # => c(TRUE, FALSE)
c(TRUE, TRUE) | c(TRUE, FALSE) # => c(TRUE, TRUE)

xor(c(FALSE, TRUE, TRUE), c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE))
# => c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
```
:::

## logical operators

:::{.fragment .small}
there are a few more logical operators which you may not need to use
often.
:::

:::{.incremental .small}
  * `&&` and `||` are **not** vectorized and evaluate from left-to-right 
  only proceeding until the result is determined (meaning: they exit early
  if a result can be determined without looking at the whole expression)
:::

:::{.fragment .xxsmall}
```{.r code-line-numbers="|1-5|7-11|"}
# for example, the following code will never evaluate
# `complicated_expression_that_yields_something` because the && operator will
# exit early since it "knows" that both sides must be TRUE, otherwise the result
# will be FALSE
complicated_expression_that_yields_FALSE && complicated_expression_that_yields_something

# similarly, the following code will never evaluate
# `complicated_expression_that_yields_something` because the || operator will
# exit early since it "knows" that if either side is TRUE, the result will be
# TRUE
complicated_expression_that_yields_TRUE || complicated_expression_that_yields_something
```
:::

:::{.fragment .xsmall}
the point of these operators is fundamentally about <span
class='carrot'>**computational efficiency**</span>. these operators become
especially beneficial if the arguments given are computationally
demanding to compute, or there's a real need for the code to be extremely fast.
:::

## logical operators

:::{.fragment .small}
remember, you can always get help for the logical operators by entering `?"&"`
or `help("&")` into R.  doing this (or replacing `&` with any of the other
logical operators) will bring up the help pages for the logical operators.
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
those help pages are also online here:  <br>
<https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Logic.html>
:::

## other ways to produce logical values

:::{.fragment .small}
the <span class='carrot'>**logical operators**</span> are not the only operators or functions in R that will
produce logical values/vectors in R.
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
some operators that will produce logical values are the
<span class='carrot'>**relational operators**</span>: 

:::{.incremental}
  * `>` (greater than),  `>=` (greater than or equal to), `<` (less than),
    `<=` (less than or equal to), `==` (equal to), `!=` (not equal to)
:::
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
```r
5 > 1               # => TRUE
5 >= 5              # => TRUE
5 == 5              # => TRUE
5 != 4              # => TRUE
"apple" != "banana" # => TRUE
```
:::

## identical {.xsmall}

:::{.columns}
:::{.column}
<img src="graphics/HoduTip.png" alt='Hodu Tip!'>
:::
:::{.column}
sometimes you don't want to compare two objects element-wise, but rather
to tell if they're the exact same. 

in that situation, you can use `identical()` instead of `==`.

```{r}
x <- 1:10 * 10
y <- seq(10, 100, by = 10)

x == y
identical(x, y)
```
:::
:::

## other ways to produce logical values

:::{.fragment .xsmall}
some functions that will produce logical values are:

:::{.incremental .xsmall}
  * `any(x)` and `all(x)`
  * the `any(x)` and `all(x)` functions are designed to work with vectors
  and respectively test if *any* of the values in the vector `x` are 
  `TRUE`, and if *all* of the values in the vector `x` are `TRUE`.
  * both of these functions take an additional argument `na.rm` that defaults
  to `FALSE`.  `na.rm.` stands for "remove NAs". 
    * typically, any operation with NA is NA (and similarly for NaNs).  for example, `1 + NA == NA`.
    * if set to `TRUE`, then `any(x, na.rm = TRUE)` and `all(x, na.rm = TRUE)` will ignore
    `NA` values.
:::
:::

:::{.fragment .xxsmall}
```r
all(c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE)) # => TRUE
any(c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)) # => TRUE

all(c(TRUE, NA, TRUE))  # => NA
any(c(FALSE, TRUE, NA)) # => NA

all(c(TRUE, NA, TRUE), na.rm = TRUE)  # => TRUE
any(c(FALSE, TRUE, NA), na.rm = TRUE) # => TRUE
```
:::

## testing for membership

one function that produces logical values is the `%in%` 
operator. if you write `x %in% y`, R will return `TRUE` 
if `x` is contained in `y`. 

```r
5 %in% c(1,2,3,4,5)
#> TRUE

'a' %in% c('a', 'b', 'c')
#> TRUE

# %in% is vectorized
c(1, 2, 3) %in% c(1, 3, 5)
#>  TRUE FALSE  TRUE
```

## a quick note on T and F

:::{.fragment .small}
in R code, you may sometimes see `TRUE` and `FALSE` abbreviated to `T`
and `F`.  
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
however, this is generally advised against because the `T` and
`F` variables may be overwritten with other values. 
:::

:::{.fragment .xsmall}
```{.r}
# an example 
isTRUE(T) # => TRUE
T <- 0
isTRUE(T) # => FALSE

# but you can't overwrite `TRUE` itself
TRUE <- 0
# => Error in TRUE <- 0 : invalid (do_set) left-hand side to assignment
```
:::

:::{.fragment .small}

<https://www.r-bloggers.com/2012/12/r-tip-avoid-using-t-and-f-as-synonyms-for-true-and-false/>
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
in short, try not to use `T` and `F` as `TRUE` and `FALSE`. 
:::

## determining TRUE values {.small}

:::{.fragment}
there may be times when you need to detect which items in a vector
are `TRUE`, for example when you want to select only those values that
satisfy some condition. 
:::

:::{.fragment}
there's two ways to solve this problem: 

  * use logical indexing with vectors; or 
  * use `which()`
:::

:::{.fragment}
```{.r .xxsmall}
x <- 1:5 # x is a vector of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
y <- x * 3

y %% 2 == 0 # the %% operator can be read "remainder after division by ..." 
# in this case, `y %% 2 == 0` will be TRUE if y is even

areEven <- y %% 2 == 0
areEven
# => c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

y[areEven]
# => c(6, 12)
```
:::

## determining TRUE values {.small}

:::{.fragment}
equally valid is to use the `which()` operation to 
return an integer vector of indices where the value in the 
argument is `TRUE`.
:::

:::{.fragment}
```{.r .xxsmall}
x <- 1:5 # x is a vector of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
y <- x * 3

y %% 2 == 0 # the %% operator can be read "remainder after division by ..." 
# in this case, `y %% 2 == 0` will be TRUE if y is even

areEven <- y %% 2 == 0
areEven
# => c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)

which(areEven)
# => c(2, 4)
# i.e., the 2nd and 4th values are even

y[which(areEven)]
# => c(6, 12)
```
:::


# conditionals {background-image='transition_slides/tyler-springhetti.jpg' background-color='black' background-opacity='60%'}

## if 

:::{.fragment .small}
in programming, <span class='carrot'>**control statements**</span> refer to code
that the computer uses to decide what set of following code statements (also called
expressions) should be run.
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
the first control statement we'll be looking at is the `if` statement. 
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
```r
# the syntax for an if statement:
if (logical_expression) {
  code_to_run 
}
```
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
the `code_to_run` in the example will only be run if the `logical_expression` is
`TRUE`.
:::

:::{.fragment .xsmall .popup}
occasionally you may see R code where an `if` statement is written inline
without curly braces like `if (condition) code_to_run` — this is not considered
to be best practice and should generally be avoided.
:::

## an example 

:::{.fragment .small}
meet the `sample.int()` function: given an argument `n`, and a `size`, it will randomly choose
`size` number of integers (with or without replacement depending on the `replace` argument) from 
the integers 1 through `n`.
<br><br>
:::


:::{.fragment .xsmall}
```r
x <- sample.int(n = 10, size = 1) # sample a number between 1 and 10

# if x is greater than or equal to 5, print the result
if (x >= 5) { 
  print(x)
}

# => this might print something like 7, or it might not print anything!
```
:::

## another example 

:::{.fragment .small}
here's an example where we have characters in a list, along with their pets, and
we want to grab random a random character and print their pet's name, but avoid
printing NULL to the console.
:::

:::{.fragment .xxsmall}
```r
characters <- list(
  harry = list(pet = 'hedwig'),
  ron = list(pet = c('scabbers', 'pigwidgeon')),
  hermione = list(pet = 'crookshanks'),
  hagrid = list(pet = c('fang', 'aragog')),
  dumbledore = list(pet = 'fawkes'),
  filch = list(pet = 'mrs. norris')
  fred = list(), # fred and george don't have pets
  george = list()
)

random_character <- characters[[sample.int(n = length(characters), size = 1)]]
random_character_pet <- random_character$pet

if (! is.null(random_character_pet)) {
  print(random_character_pet)
}

# this might print one or two pets, or it might not print anything! 

# to be clear, this will _not_ print NULL, which is what the value of 
# characters$fred$pet is, for example.
```
:::

## paste0

:::{.fragment .small}
before introducing the next <span class='carrot'>**control statement**</span>
let's talk about the `paste0` command: `paste0("string one", "string two")` will
concatenate the strings given to it and return `"string onestring two"`. it will
take as many arguments as you give it. <br><br>
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
`paste0` is a sister function to `paste` which takes `sep` as an argument for
what should be inserted between the strings given, and defaults to a single 
space.
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
here's an example: 
```r
x <- "hello "
y <- "world"
z <- "!"
paste0(x, y, z)
#> "hello world!"
```
:::

## if and else 

:::{.fragment .small}
now we can add another branch to the code by adding an else condition.
:::

:::{.fragment .xxsmall}
```{.r code-line-numbers="|12-15|17-18|19-22|24-27|"}
characters <- list(
  harry = list(pet = 'hedwig'),
  ron = list(pet = c('scabbers', 'pigwidgeon')),
  hermione = list(pet = 'crookshanks'),
  hagrid = list(pet = c('fang', 'aragog')),
  dumbledore = list(pet = 'fawkes'),
  filch = list(pet = 'mrs. norris')
  fred = list(), # fred and george don't have pets
  george = list()
)

random_int <- sample.int(n = length(characters), size = 1) # get a random number
random_character <- characters[[random_int]]               # get the corresponding character
random_character_name <- names(characters)[random_int]     # get their name
random_character_pet <- random_character$pet               # get their pet(s)

if (is.null(random_character_pet)) {
  print(paste0(random_character_name, " doesn't have any pets!"))
} else {
  print(paste0(random_character_name, "'s pet(s):"))
  print(random_character_pet)
}

# this might print "george doesn't have any pets!" or it might print something
# like: 
#   "these are ron's pets:"
#   "scabbers"   "pigwidgeon"
```
:::

## else if 

:::{.fragment .small}
let's say we draw a random number and want to classify it as a small, medium,
or large number depending on if it's between 1-33 (small), 34-66 (medium), 
or 66+ (large).
:::

:::{.fragment .xxsmall}
```{.r code-line-numbers="|1|6-12|6-7|8-9|10-12|17-25|17-18|19-20|21-22|23-25|26-28|"}
x <- sample.int(n = 100, size = 1) # draw a random number between 1-100


# one way to write this:
# this way takes advantage of what we know about how x was created
if (x <= 33) {
  print("x is small (i.e., between 1 and 33)")
} else if (x <= 66) {
  print("x is medium (i.e., between 34 and 66)")
} else {
  print("x is large (i.e., between 67 and 100)")
}


# another way:
# this way doesn't take advantage of what we know about x
if (x <= 33) {
  print("x is small (i.e., 33 or less)")
} else if (x <= 66) {
  print("x is medium (i.e., above 33 and up to 66)")
} else if (x <= 100) {
  print("x is large (i.e., above 67 and up to 100)")
} else {
  stop("something has gone wrong! we weren't supposed to get here")
}
# this way has an error if an unexpected situation arises -- you might try
# setting x to something silly like "apple" and running the two versions above
# again.
```
:::

# loops {background-image='transition_slides/tyler-springhetti.jpg' background-color='black' background-opacity='60%'}

## for loops

:::{.fragment .small}
a <span class='carrot'>**for loop**</span> is used to iterate over a sequence.
:::

:::{.fragment .small}
<span class='carrot'>**for loop**</span> are used when you have a block of code you want to repeat
a fixed number of times.
:::

:::{.fragment .xsmall}
```r
# the syntax for a for loop
for (iterator in sequence) {
  code_to_repeat
}
```
:::

## an example 

:::{.fragment .small}
let's say you want to print out the squares of the numbers 1 through 25. that 
would be fairly tedious to do by hand, but you can use a for loop to make it easy.
:::


:::{.fragment .xsmall}
```r
for (i in 1:25) {
  print(i^2)
}
#> [1] 1
#> [1] 4
#> [1] 9
#> [1] 16
#> [1] 25
#> [1] 36
#> [1] 49
#> [1] 64
#> [1] 81
#> [1] 100
#> [1] 121
#> [1] 144
#> [1] 169
#> [1] 196
#> [1] 225
#> [1] 256
#> [1] 289
#> [1] 324
#> [1] 361
#> [1] 400
#> [1] 441
#> [1] 484
#> [1] 529
#> [1] 576
#> [1] 625

# obviously the above code is much shorter than writing 
print(1^2)
print(2^2)
print(3^2)
print(4^2)
print(5^2)
# and so on and so forth...
```
:::

## another example

:::{.fragment .small}
for loops can iterate over any data structure that can be sequenced (i.e., indexed by an integer),
so feel free to use them with character vectors.
:::

:::{.fragment .xsmall}
```r
animals <- c('sloths', 'platypus', 'sea otters', 'ringtail lemurs')

for (animal in animals) {
  print(paste0(animal, " rule!"))
}
#> [1] "sloths rule!"
#> [1] "platypus rule!"
#> [1] "sea otters rule!"
#> [1] "ringtail lemurs rule!"
```
:::

## a more realistic example

:::{.fragment .small}
here's one situation I find myself running into at least a few times a year:
occasionally I'll find U.S. national data in Excel or CSV files that are split
up by state. If I'm lucky, they'll be named something like `Alabama.csv`,
`Alaska.csv`, `Arizona.csv`, ...

This is a great situation to use a for loop!
:::

:::{.fragment .xxsmall}
```r
state_data <- list() # start with an empty list

for (state in state.name) {  # state.name is a list of state names built into R

  # we'll talk more about reading in data later today
  new_data <- read.csv(file = paste0(state, ".csv")) 
  
  # create a list element for the data being read in named after the state
  state_data[[state]] <- state_data 
}

# clean up the state_data list
```
:::

## another example with states

:::{.fragment .small}
sometimes you'll want to use indexing in a for loop to reference values
within multiple sequences at the same time. 

here's an example:
:::

:::{.fragment .xxsmall}
```r
for (i in 1:50) {
  print(paste0("the abbreviation for ", state.name[i], " is ", state.abb[i]))
}
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Alabama is AL"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Alaska is AK"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Arizona is AZ"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Arkansas is AR"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for California is CA"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Colorado is CO"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Connecticut is CT"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Delaware is DE"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Florida is FL"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Georgia is GA"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Hawaii is HI"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Idaho is ID"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Illinois is IL"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Indiana is IN"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Iowa is IA"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Kansas is KS"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Kentucky is KY"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Louisiana is LA"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Maine is ME"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Maryland is MD"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Massachusetts is MA"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Michigan is MI"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Minnesota is MN"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Mississippi is MS"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Missouri is MO"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Montana is MT"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Nebraska is NE"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Nevada is NV"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for New Hampshire is NH"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for New Jersey is NJ"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for New Mexico is NM"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for New York is NY"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for North Carolina is NC"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for North Dakota is ND"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Ohio is OH"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Oklahoma is OK"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Oregon is OR"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Pennsylvania is PA"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Rhode Island is RI"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for South Carolina is SC"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for South Dakota is SD"
#> [1] "the abbreviation for Tennessee is TN"

## while {.small}

:::{.fragment}
a `while` loop allows you to repeatedly run some code <span class='carrot'>**until a condition is met**</span>.
:::

:::{.fragment}
this has the advantage that you don't have to know how many times the
code will be run in advance, in contrast to a `for` loop where you have to have
a pre-determined sequence that you'll iterate along.
:::

##  

:::{.fragment}
here's a hypothetical: if you draw numbers between 1 through 
10 randomly and sum them up, how long will it take you to get a value of at least 100? <br><br>
:::

:::{.fragment}
it won't ever take longer than 100 iterations, and it can't take less than 10 iterations. <br><br>
:::

:::{.fragment}
the expected draw is 5.5, so it should take around 18.2 summations on average, I would think.

value <- 0 
while (value < 100) {
  value <- value + sample.int(n = 10, size = 1)

that's great, but it doesn't tell us about how many iterations it took

what if we want to create a larger sample of data to see if our hypothesis was
close to some observed data?
