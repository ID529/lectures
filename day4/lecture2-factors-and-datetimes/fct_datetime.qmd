# Factors

## What are factors? {.smaller}

<br>

::: incremental
-   A **factor** is an integer vector that uses **levels** to store
    attribute information.

    -   Levels serve as the logical link between **integers** and
        **categorical** values.

-   You can transform numeric values or character strings into factors,
    it's just another class of data

-   Factors retain the order of your variables through levels.

-   Factors have a lot more rules than character strings

    -   Once you understand the rules, you have a lot more manual
        control over your data (while still being reproducible)
:::

## What are factors? {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="45%"}
Factors are particularly useful for ordinal data, where our data is
categorical, but there is an order to the categories. <br> <br> Factors
are also useful when values are repeated frequently, and there's a
pre-specified set of distinct levels.
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
<br>
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}
For example:

-   Age groups

-   Quantile groups

-   Months/Days of the week
:::
:::

## Working with factors {.smaller}

<br> Your data may already have variables as factors, or you can set
them manually with `factor()`. <br> <br>

::: fragment
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The penguins data has several variables that come pre-set as factors.
Based on the column names, which ones seem like good factor candidates?
:::

::: {.column width="10%"}
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
```{r}
library(palmerpenguins)
colnames(penguins)

```
:::
:::
:::

## Working with factors {.smaller}

<br> The `glimpse()` function gives us an idea of the class of each
column. <br>

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)

```

## Working with factors {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Let's look at the `species` column to see how R handles factors. <br>
<br> What do you notice about the output?

::: incremental
-   R returns the values in the order they appear in the dataset
-   It also returns a "levels" statement with the values in alphabetical
    order
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
unique(penguins$species)
```
:::
:::

## Factor rules {.smaller}

<br> - R by default returns your data in the order it occurs

-   Factors create an order and retain that order for all future uses of
    the variable

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 90%
#| fig-asp: 0.4
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species)) + 
  geom_bar()

```

## Changing the factor order: `fct_infreq()` {.smaller}

<br> We may want to change the default factor order (alphabetical) and
rearrange the order on the x axis. `forcats::` gives us lots of options
for rearranging our factors without having to manually list out all of
the levels. <br> <br> `fct_infreq()` allows us to sort by occurrence:

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 90%
#| fig-asp: 0.4

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = fct_infreq(species))) + 
  geom_bar()

```

## Changing the factor order: `fct_rev()` {.smaller}

<br> `fct_rev()` flips the order in reverse

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 90%
#| fig-asp: 0.4
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = fct_rev(species))) + 
  geom_bar()
```

::: columns
::: column
![](images/HoduBubble.png){fig-align="center" height="40%"
fig-alt="Hodu tip! A picture of Hodu booping a bubble"}
:::

::: column
If you're doing a lot of different analyses and visualization, you may
want to change the factor order quite often. <br> <br> Consider using
these functions locally within your code so that you're not actually
changing the underlying dataset and future analyses.
:::
:::

## Factor rules: Missingness {.smaller}

<br>

::: incremental
-   Factors have a specific set of rules for missing values

    -   Factors retain NAs, but do not return NAs as a level by default
    -   Helpfully, it doesn't drop NAs from the analysis, just because
        it's not a level
    -   NAs will always be last in the factor order
:::

::: fragment
Let's look at the `sex` column:

```{r}
unique(penguins$sex)
```
:::

## Factor rules: Missingness {.smaller}

<br>

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = sex)) + 
  geom_bar()
```

## Factor rules: Missingness {.smaller}

<br>

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig.dpi: 900
#| out-width: 70%
#| fig-asp: 0.618
#| fig-align: center
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~island)
```

## Empty groups + NAs in factors {.smaller}

<br>

-   Once levels are set, they will be retained and kept consistent
    between groups, even when there is nothing in the group

-   NAs are not considered their own group by default

    -   They are not dropped, but they aren't considered a "level"

## Empty groups + NAs in factors {.smaller}

<br> Let's look at just the Adelie penguins. <br> <br> Because `species`
is a factor, the information about other species is retained, even when
there is nothing in that category. <br>

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
adelie_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  filter(species == "Adelie")

unique(adelie_penguins$species)
```

<br>

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: column
table(adelie_penguins$species)

```

<br>

```{r}
#| output-location: column
table(as.character(adelie_penguins$species))
```
:::

## Empty groups + NAs in factors {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
``` r
ggplot(adelie_penguins, 
       aes(x = sex, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~island)
```

::: fragment
<br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
ggplot(adelie_penguins, aes(x = sex, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  facet_wrap(~island)

```
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
``` {.r code-line-numbers="4"}
ggplot(adelie_penguins, 
       aes(x = sex, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_discrete(drop=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~island)
```
:::

::: fragment
<br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
ggplot(adelie_penguins, aes(x = sex, fill = species)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_discrete(drop=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~island)

```
:::
:::
:::

## Empty groups + NAs in factors {.smaller}

<br>

-   Remember: NAs are not considered a factor level, so if we filter out
    the NAs, they will not be included in the legend even if we specify
    to keep all levels.

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-asp: 0.4
female_penguins <- penguins %>% 
  filter(sex == "female")

ggplot(female_penguins, aes(x = species, fill = sex)) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  scale_fill_discrete(drop=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~island)

```

## Advantages of factors/use cases {.smaller}

<br>

-   Retain the order of a variable, even if it is different between
    facets

    -   Improves reproducibility! Between scripts, computers,
        datasets...

-   Recode variables to have more intuitive labels

-   Regressions/other analyses

    -   Set reference levels for categorical data

## Example: NHANES {.smaller}

<br>

Let's say we want to turn a continuous variable into categorical groups:

-   Age quartiles

-   Clinically relevant blood pressure categories

::: aside
Both would benefit from factors!
:::

## Creating age quartiles {.smaller}

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment

# what is in the age column? 
summary(nhanes$age)

```

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
# create age quartiles
nhanes$age_quartiles <- ntile(nhanes$age, 4)

# what type of data is age_quartile? 
class(nhanes$age_quartiles)
```

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 70%
#| fig-asp: 0.4
ggplot(nhanes, aes(x = age_quartiles, y = mean_BP)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

```
:::

## Transforming `age_quartiles` into a factor {.smaller}

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment

nhanes$age_quartiles <- factor(nhanes$age_quartiles)

# now what type of data is age_quartile? 
class(nhanes$age_quartiles)
```

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 90%
#| fig-asp: 0.4
ggplot(nhanes, aes(x = age_quartiles, y = mean_BP)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Transforming `age_quartiles` into a factor {.smaller}

What if we wanted the labels to convey more information?

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
nhanes <- nhanes %>% 
  group_by(age_quartiles) %>% 
  mutate(age_quartiles = factor(age_quartiles, 
                                labels = c(paste0("(", min(age), "-", max(age), ")"))))

unique(nhanes$age_quartiles)


```

## Transforming `age_quartiles` into a factor {.smaller}

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-asp: 0.4
ggplot(nhanes, aes(x = age_quartiles, y = mean_BP)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Creating blood pressure categories {.smaller}

We also want to create clinically relevant categories of blood pressure:

```{r}
nhanes$bp_cat <- case_when(nhanes$mean_BP < 90 ~ "low BP",
                           nhanes$mean_BP > 140 ~ "high BP",
                           TRUE ~ "normal BP")
```

## Creating blood pressure categories {.smaller}

Because `bp_cat` is not a factor yet, R has plotted the variable in
alphabetical order by default. There may be some situations where this
is sufficient, but for ordinal data, the order of the data is important!

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 90%
#| fig-asp: 0.4

# look at blood pressure categories with age
ggplot(nhanes, aes(x = bp_cat, y = age)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Transforming `bp_cat` into a factor {.smaller}

```{r}
# manually set the order
nhanes$bp_cat <- factor(nhanes$bp_cat, levels = c("high BP", "normal BP", "low BP"))

# now the levels will retain the order for us 
unique(nhanes$bp_cat)
```

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-asp: 0.4

# when we plot it, the order will be determined by the levels
ggplot(nhanes, aes(x = bp_cat, y = age)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
:::

## Working with Factors {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The `forcats::` package (short for "**For Cat**egorical") is a helpful
set of functions for working with factors.

## Useful `forcats::` functionss {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Check out the `forcats::` cheatsheet for more info on how these
functions work!

-   `fct_drop()`

-   `fct_relevel()`

-   `fct_rev()`

:::
:::

::: aside
These functions can be temperamental! If it's not working as you expect,
you can always go back to manually setting the order with `factor()`
:::

## Incorporating factors into your workflow {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   When you read in data, check how your variables load

    -   Do you have factors, when you really want strings? Do you have
        strings, when you really want factors?

    -   If you do have factors, check the levels with `levels()` or
        `unique()`

-   Plan out your script with pseudocode

    -   On your second pass through, think through which stages factors
        might be most helpful for and add it to your pseudocode

        -   Is your data ordinal? Do you want it sorted by another
            variable? Is there an initiative reference category?

        -   How do you want to handle NAs?

        -   Do you want to set factor order globally or locally?

-   Once you have a first draft script, make sure to check that your
    factors aren't doing anything weird
:::

## ⚠️ Caution: factors {.smaller}

<br> Factors operate under a very strict set of rules. If you aren't
careful, you can accidentally create issues in your dataset

## ⚠️ Caution: factor → numeric {.smaller}

<br> Let's say we wanted to transform a "year" column from an integer to
a factor to make a plot with a different boxplot for each year:

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: 90%
#| fig-asp: 0.4

penguins_fctyr <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(year = factor(year))

ggplot(penguins_fctyr, aes(x = species, y = flipper_length_mm, color = year)) + 
  geom_boxplot()

```

## ⚠️ Caution: factor → numeric {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Later in your script, you decide you want to include `year` as a
continuous variable, so you transform `year` into an integer.

```{r}

penguins_num <- penguins_fctyr %>% 
  mutate(year = as.integer(year))

unique(penguins_num$year)

```

Oh no! <br>
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
So what do you do?

-   In some cases, you may want to set factors locally within a
    particular piece of your script, rather than globally.
-   For example, you could run `as.factor()` around `year` within your
    `ggplot()`.

```{r}
#| eval: FALSE
ggplot(penguins, aes(x = species, 
                     y = flipper_length_mm, 
                     color = as.factor(year))) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
:::
:::
:::

## ⚠️ Caution: typos {.smaller}

::: fragment
<br> If you don't have **exact** matches when you assign factor levels
and labels, you're going to end up with a lot of NAs

```{r}

penguins_sizes <- penguins %>% 
  mutate(size_cat = case_when(bill_length_mm > mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = T) &
                                bill_depth_mm > mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = T) & 
                                flipper_length_mm > mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T) ~ "big penguins",
                              bill_length_mm < mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = T) &
                                bill_depth_mm < mean(bill_depth_mm, na.rm = T) & 
                                flipper_length_mm < mean(flipper_length_mm, na.rm = T) ~ "small penguins",
                              TRUE ~ "average penguins"))

table(penguins_sizes$size_cat, useNA = "ifany")

```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}

penguins_sizes$size_cat <- factor(penguins_sizes$size_cat, levels = c("smol penguins", "average penguins", "big penguins"))

table(penguins_sizes$size_cat, useNA = "ifany")

# Date-Times

## Working with dates {.smaller}

<br>

-   What are some challenges you might anticipate working with dates?

## Working with dates {.smaller}

<br> Often, we need dates to function as both strings and numbers

-   As strings, we want to have a fair amount of control over how they
    are presented.

-   As numbers, we may want to add/subtract time, account for time
    zones, and present them at different scales.

## Working with dates {.smaller}

<br> There are lots of packages and functions that are helpful for
working with dates. We'll talk primarily about the `lubridate::`
package, but the goal today is to understand the components and rules of
date-time objects so that you can apply these functions in your work.

## Working with dates {.smaller}

<br> There are 3 ways that we will work with date/time data:

-   dates

-   times

-   date-times

::: aside
date-times are the most granular way to represent a moment in time!
:::

## Working with dates 🤯😳 {.smaller}

<br> For the most part, we're going to try to work with dates as Date
objects, but you may see a date that defaults to `POSIXct`. <br> <br>
All computers store dates as numbers, typically as time (in seconds)
since some origin. That's all that `POSIXct` is -- to be more specific,
it is the time in seconds since 1970 in the UTC time zone (GMT).

## 

<br> <br>

<center>🚨**!IMPORTANT!**🚨 <br> From this point forward, all times will
be presented in 24-hour time!!</center>

## Working with dates {.smaller}

<br> To get an idea of how R works with dates, let's ask for the current
date/time:

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
today()
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
now()
```
:::
:::

## Working with dates {.smaller}

<br> But how do we actually work with this data? In practice, we might
want to:

::: incremental
-   Know how much time has elapsed between two samples
-   Collapse daily measurements into monthly averages
-   Check whether a measurement was taken in the morning or evening
-   Know which day of the week a measurement was taken on
-   Convert time zones
:::

## `lubridate::` {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="40%"}
The `lubridate::` package is a handy way of storing and processing
date-time objects. `lubridate::` categorizes date-time objects by the
component of the date-time string they represent:

-   year
-   month
-   day
-   hour
-   minute
-   second
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
![Artwork by \@allison_horst](images/lubridate.png)
:::
:::

## `lubridate::` basics {.smaller}

![](images/lubridate_hex.png){.absolute right="0" top="1" height="20%"}

::: {.column width="85%"}
Once you have a date-time object, you can use `lubridate::` functions to
extract and manipulate the different components.

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: column
year(now())
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: column
month(now())
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: column

```
:::

```{r}
#| output-location: column
day(now())
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: column
yday(now())

```{r}
#| output-location: column
wday(now())
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: column
wday(now(), label = TRUE)
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: column
hour(now())
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
#| output-location: column
minute(now())
```
:::

```{r}
#| output-location: column

```
:::
:::

## `lubridate::` basics {.smaller}

![](images/lubridate_hex.png){.absolute right="0" top="1" height="20%"}

::: {.column width="85%"}
The function `now()` returns a date-time object, while `today()` returns
just a date. `lubridate::` also has functions that allow us to force the
date into a date-time and the date-time into a date:
:::

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
today()
```

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
as_datetime(today())
```
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
```{r}
now()
```

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
as_date(now())
```
:::
:::

## `lubridate::` basics {.smaller}

![](images/lubridate_hex.png){.absolute right="0" top="1" height="20%"}

::: {.column width="85%"}
With `lubridate::`, we can also work with dates as a whole, rather than
their individual components. Let's say we have a character string with
the date, but we want R to transform it into a date-time object: <br>

```{r}
#| output-location: column-fragment
ymd("2023-01-12")
```

```{r}
#| output-location: column-fragment
ymd_hms("2023-01-12 13:30:00")
```

```{r}
#| output-location: column-fragment
ymd_hms("2023-01-12 13:30:00", tz = "EST")
```
:::

::: aside
`lubridate::` also allows you to move around the order of `ymd()`, so
you can also run `dmy()` or `mdy()` -- however, the order is telling R
how to identify the different components of your date, rather than what
you want it to be.
:::

## Time spans {.smaller}

<br> There are three classes we can apply to our date-times so that we
can work with them arithmetically 🧙️

-   durations (measured in seconds)
-   periods (measured in weeks/months)
-   intervals (have a start and end point)

## Time spans {.smaller}

<br>

::: columns
::: {.column width="30%"}
**Durations**

-   fixed length in seconds

```{r}
ddays(9)
```
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
<br>
:::

::: {.column width="30%"}
**Periods**

-   "human" times

```{r}
days(9)
```
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
<br>
:::

::: {.column width="33%"}
**Intervals**

-   a duration with a start/end point

```{r}
interval(start = today(), 
         end = today() + days(1))
```
:::
:::

## Durations: Subtraction {.smaller}

<br> We can use arithmetic operators with durations: <br>

```{r}
# how long does this class meet for each day? 
class_length <- ymd_hms("2023-01-17 17:30:00") -  ymd_hms("2023-01-17 13:30:00")
class_length
```

<br> <br>

::: fragment
Using an `as.duration()` wrapper, the result will be returned as a
duration object: <br>

```{r}

## Periods {.smaller}

<br> Since periods operate using "human" time, we can add to periods
using functions like `minutes()`, `hours()`, `days()`, and `weeks()`
<br>

```{r}

## Intervals {.smaller}

<br> Intervals can be created with the `interval()` function or with
`%--%`. By default, intervals will be created in the date-time format
you input. <br>

```{r}
interval(start = today(), end = ymd("2023-01-20"))
today() %--% ymd("2023-01-20")

::: fragment
We can use `%within%` to check whether a date falls within our interval:
<br>

```{r}
class_date_interval <- interval(start = min(ymd(class_dates)), 
                                end = max(ymd(class_dates)))

#check whether a date happens during class
ymd("2023-01-22") %within% class_date_interval
ymd("2023-01-12") %within% class_date_interval

<br> Often, we have really granular data that we want to report in some
aggregate form. This data is measured in 1-second intervals, but let's
say we wanted to calculate a 1-minute average or an hourly average. <br>
<br> Because we separated date_time into it's various components, we can
now use `group_by()` and `summarize()` to calculate averages.

date-times.

  readr::read_csv("us-counties-2021.csv"),
  readr::read_csv("us-counties-2022.csv")
)

covid <- bind_rows(covid)


# cleaning ----------------------------------------------------------------

covid$geoid <- stringr::str_replace_all(covid$geoid, "USA-", "")

# aggregate up to monthly observations 

covid <- covid |> 
  mutate(
    year_month = paste0(lubridate::year(date), "-", lubridate::month(date))
  )

covid$year_month <- factor(covid$year_month, levels = 
                       paste0(rep(2020:2022, each = 12), "-", rep(1:12, 3)))

## Key takeaways {.smaller}

-   Knowing how to manipulate factors and date-times can save you a ton
    of headache -- you'll have a lot more control over your data which
    can help with cleaning, analysis, and visualization!

-   `forcats::` and `lubridate::` give you a lot of the functionality
    you might need

    -   `hms::` is another package for working with times (stores time
        as seconds since 00:00:00, so you can easily convert between
        numeric and hms)

-   Factors and date-times can be tricky

    -   Double check things are working as you expect along the way!!

    -   If you can't figure out why something isn't working, take a
        break, and revisit it with fresh eyes.

    -   There's lots of documentation out there! The cheatsheets are
        great, as is The Epidemiologist R Handbook
        (https://epirhandbook.com/en/working-with-dates.html#working-with-dates-1)
