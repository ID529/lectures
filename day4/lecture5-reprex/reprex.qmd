## Best practices for getting help in R {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: incremental
-   Don't ask for someone else to put in more work helping you than you're willing to put in

    -   Before you ask for help did you:

        -   Google your error message?

        -   Check your spelling? Check your commas?

    -   Ask your question in a way that minimizes the amount of time someone has to spend to answer it

-   Don't be a meanie

-   Pass it on! We've all benefited from the time/wisdom of a colleague/stranger -- be that for someone else when you can!

    -   Sometimes it's helpful just to have someone to talk things through with!

## What is a reproducible example? {.smaller}
<br>
Reproducible examples:

-   Use a minimal/basic/small dataset (it doesn't have to be interesting, it just has to work!)

-   Are able to be run on any computer (does not depend on data you have on your computer)

<br>

::: {.fragment .highlight-red}

Think: what is the simplest version of the data that I need in order to reproduce the error

## Advantages of reproducible examples: {.smaller}

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}

::: incremental
-   Anyone, anywhere in the world can help you!

    -   They can run your code on their computer to recreate the issue

    -   They can help, even if they're not subject matter experts

-   You are less likely to get yelled at by a collaborator or on stack overflow

-   You might even solve your own problem along the way!

# Making a reproducible example {.smaller} 
<br>
<br>

::: aside
 this is sometimes called a "reprex" 😎
:::

## Option #1: Recreate your issue with simple dummy data 

```{r}

dat <- data.frame(x = c(rep(1:2, 3)),
                  y = c(rep(c("a", "b", "c"), 2)))

```

## Option #2: Recreate your issue with built-in datasets {.smaller}

-   Try `mtcars` or `iris`
    
      -   Be familiar with what is in these datasets! They're commonly used for examples in R4DS and online.

```{r}

glimpse(mtcars)

glimpse(iris)

```

## Option #2b: Recreate your issue with other common datasets {.smaller}

-   mtcars and iris are built in data sets, but other good ones are `starwars` (in the `dplyr::` package),  `penguins` (in the `palmerpenguins::` package), and `flights` (in the `nycflights13::` package)

-   These might provide you with a little more complexity (some missingness, more data, different classes), while still being relatively simple/intuitive

```{r}

glimpse(dplyr::starwars)

```

## Option #2b: Recreate your issue with other common datasets {.smaller}


-   mtcars and iris are built in data sets, but other good ones are `starwars` (in the `dplyr::` package),  `penguins` (in the `palmerpenguins::` package), and `flights` (in the `nycflights13::` package)

-   These might provide you with a little more complexity (some missingness, more data, different classes), while still being relatively simple/intuitive

```{r}

glimpse(palmerpenguins::penguins)

```

## Option #2b: Recreate your issue with other common datasets {.smaller}


-   mtcars and iris are built in data sets, but other good ones are `starwars` (in the `dplyr::` package),  `penguins` (in the `palmerpenguins::` package), and `flights` (in the `nycflights13::` package)

-   These might provide you with a little more complexity (some missingness, more data, different classes), while still being relatively simple/intuitive

```{r}

glimpse(nycflights13::flights)

```




## Option #3: Modify your own data {.smaller}
<br>

There may be something specific to your data that is hard to recreate with another dataset.
<br>
<br>
If that is the case, you can consider sharing a small and stripped down version of your data so that someone else can reproduce it. 

## When asking for help: Writing a good request {.smaller}
<br>
Provide context:

-   Go back to your pseudocode and use that as an outline for describing where something is going wrong: 

      -   What do you have? (describe the type of data or analysis)

      -   What are you trying to accomplish?

      -   What have you tried already?

      -   What is the issue with what you've tried?

## When asking for help: Providing useful code {.smaller}
<br>

-   Cut anything unrelated to the issue

-   Keep anything that is required, including loading specific packages

    -   If a package is particularly obscure, consider using `packagename::function()`

<br>

-   If you're including your own dataset, use intuitive variable names and good coding practices

    -   Write in lower case and use `_` instead of `.`

    -   Provide concise and meaningful variable names

## Example: Creating blood pressure categories {.smaller}
<br>
Let's imagine that we want to create a new variable that categorizes participants by blood pressure. We want to create column called `bp_cat` that groups them into the following bins:

-   high BP (\>140 mm Hg)

-   low BP (\< 90 mm Hg)

-   normal BP (90-140 mm Hg)

```{r}
# nhanes1314 <- data.frame(id = c(1:5),
#            mean_BP = c(88, 125, 130, 155, 75))

summary(nhanes$mean_BP)

```

```{r}
#| output-location: fragment
nhanes$bp_cat <- case_when(nhanes$mean_BP > 140 ~ "high BP",
                           nhanes$mean_BP >= 90 | nhanes$mean_BP <= 140 ~ "normal BP",
                           nhanes$mean_BP <= 90 ~ "low BP"
)

table(nhanes$bp_cat, useNA = "ifany")

```

## Drafting a message {.smaller}
<br>
Describe the type of data or analysis:

-   I'm working with the 2013-2014 cycle of NHANES data provided by the ID529 teaching team.

What are you trying to accomplish?

-   I have a numeric mean blood pressure measurements for all participants and I'd like to categorize them into clinically relevant groups (high, low, normal).

```{r}
nhanes1314 <- data.frame(id = c(1:5),
           mean_BP = c(88, 125, 130, 155, 75))
```

## Drafting a message {.smaller}

What have you tried already?

-   I'm using a `case_when()` approach to group them based on a relational operator evaluating the mean_BP column.

```{r}
nhanes1314$bp_cat <- case_when(nhanes1314$mean_BP > 140 ~ "high BP",
                           nhanes1314$mean_BP >= 90 |
                             nhanes1314$mean_BP <= 140 ~ "normal BP",
                           nhanes1314$mean_BP <= 90 ~ "low BP"
)
```

What is the issue with what you've tried?

-   Measurements less than 90 should be flagged as "low BP" but are being categorized as "normal BP"

```{r}
nhanes1314

```


## Putting it all together {.smaller}

![](images/examplemessage.png){fig-align="center" width=30% fig-alt="a slack message from amanda reads: Hi everyone! I'm working with the 2013-2014 cycle of NHANES data provided by the ID529 teaching team. I have a numeric mean blood pressure measurements for all participants and I'd like to categorize them into clinically relevant groups: high (\>140 mmHg), normal (90-120 mmHg), and low (\<90). I'm using a case_when() approach to group them based on a relational operator evaluating the mean_BP column. However, when the function evaluates the category, some of the measurements less than 90 that should be flagged as 'low BP' are being categorized as 'normal BP' -- can anyone help me figure out why the low BP group is not working as expected? Thanks!"}

## More best practices for posting code on Slack: {.smaller}

-   What we don't want to see:

    -   Everything is named "dat" and "dat1" when intuitive names are more appropriate

    -   Really long lines of code on one line

        -   Try to limit to \~80 characters
        
        -   Use new lines after a `%>%` or `+`

-   what we do want to see:

    -   Apply some of these best practices

    -   Use Slack's code and code block in your messages to help organize your message

    -   updates: if you resolve your own question, post the solution as a thread on the original post. That way others can learn from what you did. 

    -   Make sure your question is clear -- run it by a friend first, if needed!

    -   Make sure your question isn't redundant -- people will just redirect you to the answer


## How do I find a good reprex? {.smaller}

<br>
Check out the datasets that are built into R here: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/datasets/html/00Index.html

## Key takeaways: How do I not get yelled (at on the internet or by collaborators)? {.smaller}

-   Use the most minimally reproducible dataset

    -   If relevant, you may want to include the session info, R version

-   Don't post screenshots of the code! (check out `reprex::` for best practices)

-   Don't ask others to do more work than you're willing to put in + help others the way you want to be helped!
