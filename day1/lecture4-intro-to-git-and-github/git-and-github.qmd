# why version control? 

:::{.incremental}
  * makes coordinating files across computers easy 💻
  * keeps a clean history of your code evolution 📜
    * no need for messy suffixes (v1, v2, ..., v19380, vfinal) 🗂
  * gives you the chance to ask yourself "do i really want to make these changes?" 🤔
  * streamlines review of external code changes 👥

## why git? 

  - it's popular! in the stackoverflow developer survey, 93.9% of developers
  using version control software said they use git.

<img src="images/developer_survey.png" 
  width='500px'
  alt="stackoverflow developer survey shows that 93.9% of developers who use version control use git"></a>

the result is that git comes with a *large resource base* and is *compatible* with all 
the major operating systems.

## a bit about git

:::{.incremental .smaller}
  - git is an **<span class='carrot'>open-source version control system</span>**.
  - git stores code and its history in a <span class='carrot'>**repository**</span>.
  - each revision to the code is added to the repository through a <span class='carrot'>**commit**</span> process.
  - git allows you to have <span class='carrot'>**branches**</span> of your code that keeps development <span class='carrot'>**separate**</span>
  from the main codebase until it is complete.
    - the main version of your code is often on the <span class='carrot'>**"main"**</span> branch
      (what used to be called the <span class='carrot'>**"master"**</span> branch).
  - git allows you to <span class='carrot'>**push**</span> or <span class='carrot'>**pull**</span> code from <span class='carrot'>**remote**</span> servers.

## personal reflections

:::{.incremental .smaller}
  - what features of git and github are you looking to leverage the most? 
  - look through examples of successful repositories
    - mathew kiang (assistant professor at stanford) has some great repositories
    focused on epidemiological and population health research
      - <https://github.com/mkiang> {{< fa brands github >}}
    - take a look at the repository for dplyr: <br> <https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr> {{< fa brands github >}}
:::

<!-- info / docs for the quarto fontawesome extension: 
https://github.com/quarto-ext/fontawesome --> 

:::{.notes}
we suggest the following points for personal reflection.

also, if you're working with high security code, you should contact your local 
it department before uploading anything to an external server like github. 
:::
    
## installation

:::{.incremental}
  - you’ll need to install git: the installation procedures depend on if
you’re on windows, mac, or linux.
  - follow the installation instructions here https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html:
    - [download git for osx](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
    - [download git for windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
    - [download git for linux](https://git-scm.com/download/linux)
:::
    
## local setup

:::{.incremental}
  - after installation, you'll need to **configure** git:
  
:::{.fragment .xsmall}
```sh
git config --global user.name 'she-ra, princess of power'
git config --global user.email 'adora@eternia.com'
git config --global --list
```
:::

  - use the **same name** and **email address** you are going
  to use with github.
  - i would highly recommend using a long-term personal email rather than your institutional
  email so it's easy to carry your portfolio of work on github on with you after
  you graduate.

  - pick an <span class='carrot'>**appropriate**</span> username you will be comfortable revealing to future bosses
  - <span class='carrot'>**shorter** </span>is better
    - be as unique as possible in as few characters as possible
  - make it <span class='carrot'>**timeless**</span>
    - don't highlight your current university, employer, or place of
    residence since these can all change
  - all <span class='carrot'>**lowercase**</span> is recommended

## optimal commit messages 📮


:::{.incremental .small}
  - capitalize the first word and do not end in punctuation.
  - use imperative mood in the subject line.
    * example: “add fix for data reading error”
  - specify the type of commit. it is recommended and beneficial to have
    a consistent set of words to describe your changes.
    * example: bugfix, update, refactor, bump, and so on.
  - the first line should ideally be no longer than 50 characters.
    * be direct! try to eliminate filler words and phrases.
      * examples: though, maybe, i think, kind of.

## workflows for collaboration

:::{.columns}

:::{.column width='60%'}
:::{.incremental .small}
  - small changes – can be reasonable to work on same branch.
  - large changes – create a branch and pull request.
  - outside developer – fork repository and pull request.
  - remember – when working with collaborators, communication is key!
:::
:::

:::{.fragment .column width='40%'}
<img src="images/collaborative_workflow.jpg" alt="diagram of a remote repository with code going back and forth between three developers, each of whom push and pull from the remote repository">

:::{.xsmall}
In the centralized workflow depicted, all developers synchronize their work through 
a main shared repository (like one on GitHub).
:::
:::
:::

## git branches 

:::{.incremental .small}
  - Branches let you continue to work on your code without affecting the main 
  line of development
  - Creating branches for bug fixes and feature development prevents
  unstable code from disrupting your project or workflow.

## git forks

:::{.columns}
:::{.column .small .incremental width='50%'}
:::{.incremental}
  - forking crates a copy of a repository which allows development that will not
  affect the main project.
  - forking is particularly useful when you would like to develop on another person’s project.
  - forking can also be useful for versions of a project that are being developed in parallel without intention of future merge.

## pull requests

:::{.columns}

:::{.column .small .incremental width='40%'}
  - A pull request alerts the
repository owner that
changes have been made.

it into the repository.
  - Optimizing language in pull

# key takeaways {background-color='black' background-image="images/mountains.jpg"}

## key takeaways

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width='50%'}
:::{.incremental .xsmall}
  - git will help you version control your code, similar to track changes in MS Word,
  and collaborate with others.
  - GitHub is an online platform that will let you freely host your git repositories, 
  share them with others, and is one way to host a professional portfolio of code-based
  projects.
  - A typical individual workflow will look like: 
    1. create your R Project and
  a repository on GitHub
    2. connect them 
    3. make changes to the project
    4. add changes to the staging area (with `git add`)
    5. commit them (`git commit`)
    6. push those (`git push`), and continue making commits until the project is finished.
